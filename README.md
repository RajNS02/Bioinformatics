### DNA sequence analysis:
- Performed exploratory data analysis and classification of human DNA sequences using k-mer approach 
- Furthermore, used this trained model to classify DNA sequences in chimpanzee and dog genome

### Genomics:
- Extracted various viral genes from multiple GenBank files of bacterial genomes (Pneumoniae, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, Salmonella Typhi and E.coli) using BioPython
- Additionally, analysed different kinds of sequences present in above bacterial genomes and complied all the data in a csv format
